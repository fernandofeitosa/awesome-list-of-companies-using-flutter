# Companies using Flutter List 


A colaborative curated list of companies that use [flutter](https://flutter.dev) in their stack.


After I started using Flutter to build [Bora](https://heybora.com), I decided to look at the companies that are using Flutter to see what they are doing. Then I realized there was not a place where I could easily find them, so I created this shinny curated list of companies that use [flutter](https://flutter.dev) in their stack.


Feel free to open a pull request to include (or fix) a company info. Please keep the same formatting and alphabetical order.
